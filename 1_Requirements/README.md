# **Introduction**

An Electric Circuit is a closed path for transmitting an electric current through the medium of electrical and magnetic fields. An electric circuit includes a device that gives energy to the charged particles constituting the current, such as a battery or a generator; devices that use current, such as lamps, electric motors, or computers; and the connecting wires or transmission lines. Circuital elements are classified into active or passive elements, based on their capability to generate energy.
**Active Elements** are those which can generate energy. Examples include batteries, generators, operational amplifiers and diodes. Note that in an electrical circuit, the source elements are the most significant active elements.
**Passive Elements** can be defined as elements which can control the flow of electrons through them.They either increase or decrease the voltage. Here are some examples of passive elements.It includes a resistor, inductor, capacitor etc.

Voltage, also called electromotive force, is a quantitative expression of the potential difference in charge between two points in an electrical field.Its S.I unit is Volts(V).

Electric Current is the rate of flow of electrons in a conductor. The SI Unit of electric current is the Ampere(A).

Resistor: A resistor opposes the flow of current through it. Resistance (also known as ohmic resistance or electrical resistance) is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit. Resistance is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Ω).

Two of the basic laws that mathematically describe the performance of electric circuits are Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s rules.
## ***Ohm’s law states that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided all physical conditions and temperature remain constant.***                
                 OR
## ***Ohm’s law states the relationship between electric current and potential difference. The current that flows through most conductors is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it. Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist was the first to verify Ohm’s law experimentally.***

## **Research**
Ohm's law is a relationship between the voltage across an electric circuit, the electrical resistance in the circuit, and the current in the circuit. This law is named after its discoverer, Georg Simon Ohm. Ohm found that for most electric circuits, the voltage across the circuit was equal to the current flowing through the circuit times the electrical resistance of the circuit. For the same voltage, a circuit with a low resistance will have a higher current than a circuit with a higher resistance. The voltage, properly called the potential difference, is measured in volts, and the current in amperes (amps). The resistance is therefore in volts per ampere, which is defined as ohms.
It is important to understand that Ohm's law is not a fundamental law that always applies, such as the law of gravity.
OHM'S law is perhaps the most popularly known of all the laws,theories,and principles of electrical sciences.The law forms the starting point in the study of electrical networks,and it has reserved,forever,a place of honor for Georg Simon Ohm(1789-1854) in the history of science.The year 1976 marked the 150th anniversary of Ohm'slaw.

## Explanation

Ohm's Law is a formula used to calculate the relationship between voltage, current and resistance in an electrical circuit.

To students of electronics, Ohm's Law (E = IR) is as fundamentally important as Einstein's Relativity equation (E = mc²) is to physicists.

E = I x R

When spelled out, it means voltage = current x resistance, or volts = amps x ohms, or V = A x Ω.

Named for German physicist Georg Ohm (1789-1854), Ohm's Law addresses the key quantities at work in circuits:

Quantity	Ohm's Law
symbol	Unit of measure
(abbreviation)	Role in circuits	In case you're wondering:
Voltage	E	Volt (V)	Pressure that triggers electron flow	E = electromotive force (old-school term)
Current	I	Ampere, amp (A)	Rate of electron flow	I = intensity
Resistance	R	Ohm (Ω)	Flow inhibitor	Ω = Greek letter omega
If two of these values are known, technicians can reconfigure Ohm's Law to calculate the third. Just modify the pyramid as follows:

If you know voltage (E) and current (I) and want to know resistance (R), X-out the R in the pyramid and calculate the remaining equation (see the first, or far left, pyramid above).

### WHO:
GEORGE SIMON OHM (INVENTOR)

Georg Simon Ohm (16 March 1789 – 6 July 1854) was a German physicist and mathematician. As a school teacher, Ohm began his research with the new electrochemical cell, invented by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta. Using equipment of his own creation, Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor and the resultant electric current. This relationship is known as Ohm's law.

### WHEN
May-June 1998

In 1827 Georg Simon Ohm discovered some laws relating to the strength of a current in a wire. Ohm found that electricity acts like water in a pipe. Ohm discovered that the current in a circuit is directly proportional to the electric pressure and inversely to the resistance of the conductors.
